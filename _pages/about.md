## Research Interests

I am interested in Noncommutative Geometry and Dynamics. My current research is in étale groupoids and their C\*-algebras, as well as analysis of noncommutative Cartan pairs. In particular, I have focussed on non-Hausdorff groupoids and the respective C\*-algebraic structures, as well as studying functoriality for the groupoid C\*-algebra construction.

Another interest of mine is in the noncommutative Stone duality and geometric semigroup theory, as well as dynamics of these objects acting on C*-algebras.

Previously I have worked on computation of KK-theory for graph C*-algebras and more generally Cuntz-Pimsner algebras of graded Hilbert bimodules, using a generalised version of Pimsner’s 6-term exact sequence from Kumjian, Pask, and Sims. This work is related to my Honours thesis and was later published with Quinn Patterson, Adam Sierakowski, and Aidan Sims.

## Professional Affiliations

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Potsdam in Germany, working in the research group of Prof. Dr. Sven Raum (Professor for algebra).

I began my doctoral candidacy at University of Göttingen in October 2019 as part of the Research Training Group RTG2491 in Fourier Analysis and Spectral Theory. I worked notably with Prof. Dr. Ralf Meyer as my main doctoral advisor, as well as with Prof. Dr. Thomas Schick and Prof. Dr. Chenchang Zhu, who together form my Thesis Advisory Committee. I defended my PhD in September of 2022, graduating magna cum laude. My thesis was titled “Aperiodic dynamical inclusions of C*-algebras”.

I previously completed my Bachelor with Honours at the University of Wollongong, with my thesis “Graded K-homology for Graph C*-algebras”, under the supervision of Snr. Prof. Aidan Sims and Dr. Adam Sierakowski.

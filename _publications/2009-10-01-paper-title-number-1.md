excerpt: 'Abstract: We establish exact sequences in KK-theory for graded relative Cuntz–Pimsner algebras associated to nondegenerate C⁎-correspondences. We use this to calculate the graded K-theory and K-homology of relative Cuntz–Krieger algebras of directed graphs for gradings induced by {0,1}–valued labellings of their edge sets.
Keywords: KK-theory; Graded K-theory; C⁎-algebra; Graded C⁎-algebra''
